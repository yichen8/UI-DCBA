Emotion contagion is a process by which emotions can spread between people and among groups of people. Individuals tend to find that they feel and express emotions similar to those of other people in immediate interactions. The presence and effects of emotion contagion have been consistently replicated in laboratory research1.

In 2012, data scientists at Facebook and Cornell University partnered to explore the question of whether emotion contagion could pass from person to person through a technological platform, like Facebook. The goal of the study was to expand what researchers knew about emotion contagion in face-to-face environments to the context of digital platforms2.

For the study, the researchers conducted an experiment in which they differentially changed the main news feed for approximately 700k users. Specifically, the researchers selected a control group, whose news feed was unaltered. They then created two other groups: one group received posts in their news feed with reduced positive content, the other group received posts in their news feed with reduced negative content. The data showed that users in the “reduced positive words” group ended up posting fewer positive words themselves, and those in the “reduced negative words” group posted fewer negative words in their own subsequent posts. They also found evidence of a “withdrawal” effect, such that users exposed to less emotional content of either valence were less likely to post at all after this exposure. The effect size for this research was quite small (.0001) although the findings were statistically significant3.

Based on this data, the authors concluded that emotion contagion could spread through online platforms, in addition to spreading in face-to-face contexts. An arguably valuable and helpful finding given the prevalence of virtual communication and social media use.

Not long after the paper was published, consumer anger increased4. Media outlets reported the findings, highlighting the fact that users were not aware that they were part of the experiment.","Test Author 1 ","/content/ethics/ethics-sample-1","/content/ethics","Ethics","c8124555-d172-48c9-bdc2-b8399e44d6eb","[""Faculty"",""Student""]",,,,"/content/filter",2022-01-08T02:26:57Z,2022-01-08T02:46:52Z,"c38fd449-8de3-4bf2-ada3-cc54499e7d57",

You report to two bosses in the organization: a local boss, the general manager at the business unit (BU), and a headquarters boss (HQT), the CFO at the headquarters. 

The divisional accounting managers (DAM) have dual responsibility and provide information both to the business units and top management. First is functional responsibility. You assure that top management know the “true” financial state of the business unit. This includes regular reporting and also maintaining an informal communication line with the functional superior, such as providing early warning signals and independent judgment. Second is local responsibility. You are in charge of the local accounting system and provide reports relevant for decision-making of business unit level management. 

Should we constrain the divisional accounting managers’ autonomy to make sure you fulfill the verification role and are fully held accountable to HQT? If too much constraint is placed there, are we sacrificing the divisional accounting managers’ local responsibility in helping BU managers to make decisions?

","The purpose of this case is to help accounting students use Python to gather and analyze data to help resolve an accounting problem. Accountants deal with data every day and are increasingly under pressure to utilize the latest tools to analyze the largest data set possible to solve client problems. This case will let you use one such tool to examine millions of rows of data—all with the goal of helping a client be more profitable. 

This case will cover the key skills needed in an analytics approach to data. First, you will be required to gather, load, and clean data. Cleaning data is a critical skill that is unavoidable on any project of real substance. Second, you will describe and explore the data. This is usually the part of any project that is the most fun. Learning how to do this effectively and efficiently is critical. Third, you will use regression analysis to draw conclusions about your data. Using predictive analytics helps the analyst have more security that their recommendations are valid. Finally, you will take what you have learned to tell a story. That is, you will use what you have learned to make a recommendation to the client. 

In this case, Yellow Cab Chicago, a hypothetical cab company in Chicago, has hired your small accounting and consulting firm to help them shave costs and increase revenues. Like many traditional cab companies, Yellow Cab is feeling significant pressure from ride-hailing companies like Lyft and Uber. Your assignment is to use an authentic, existing data set to better understand the situation Yellow Cab is facing and to investigate potential revenue opportunities.

Emotion contagion is a process by which emotions can spread between people and among groups of people. Individuals tend to find that they feel and express emotions similar to those of other people in immediate interactions. The presence and effects of emotion contagion have been consistently replicated in laboratory research1.

In 2012, data scientists at Facebook and Cornell University partnered to explore the question of whether emotion contagion could pass from person to person through a technological platform, like Facebook. The goal of the study was to expand what researchers knew about emotion contagion in face-to-face environments to the context of digital platforms2.

For the study, the researchers conducted an experiment in which they differentially changed the main news feed for approximately 700k users. Specifically, the researchers selected a control group, whose news feed was unaltered. They then created two other groups: one group received posts in their news feed with reduced positive content, the other group received posts in their news feed with reduced negative content. The data showed that users in the “reduced positive words” group ended up posting fewer positive words themselves, and those in the “reduced negative words” group posted fewer negative words in their own subsequent posts. They also found evidence of a “withdrawal” effect, such that users exposed to less emotional content of either valence were less likely to post at all after this exposure. The effect size for this research was quite small (.0001) although the findings were statistically significant3.

Based on this data, the authors concluded that emotion contagion could spread through online platforms, in addition to spreading in face-to-face contexts. An arguably valuable and helpful finding given the prevalence of virtual communication and social media use.

Not long after the paper was published, consumer anger increased4. Media outlets reported the findings, highlighting the fact that users were not aware that they were part of the experiment.","Test Author 1 ","/content/ethics/ethics-sample-3","/content/ethics","Ethics","c8124555-d172-48c9-bdc2-b8399e44d6eb",,,,,"/content/filter",2022-01-08T02:45:34Z,2022-01-08T02:47:06Z,"c38fd449-8de3-4bf2-ada3-cc54499e7d57",
